    The Minarets are a formation of jagged peaks which can be seen from the town
    of Mammoth Lakes. Isabel had day hiked them a few years ago, so she was
    excited to revisit today. We were also passing under Mount Ritter and Banner
    Peak, two very classic mountains on the sierra skyline.
    <p>
      Our first objective of the day was to reach Garnet Pass, via a really
      chill walk up a grassy slope. On the way we met some fishermen with a blow
      up raft.
    </p>
    From Garnet pass we could see the next target, Whitebark Pass which had a
    menacing snowfield.

    To our surprise, 5 people appeared on top of the pass as we approached. They
    started climbing down a sketchy wall and we soon realized they were using
    rope. We chose not to go their way and instead aimed for a class 2-looking
    chute just to their left, avoiding the wall and the snowfield. Talus and
    some steep scree led us to the group of climbers. When I was within earshot
    I asked them if they didn't see the class 2 chute or if they were just
    practicing their rope skills for fun. They said they didn't see it. Isabel
    went first up the chute. We climbed up the final chimney and topped out
    right at Whitebark Pass.

    To descend, a traverse led us right of the Nydiver lakes over a saddle to
    reach a trail leading down to Ediza lake. This side of the pass was really
    chill, and I was feeling much better than I did yesterday.
    <p>
      Here we also bumped into another SHR hiker going northbound. We were the
      first shr hikers he had seen since coming from Lone Pine! He gave us some
      beta and warned us about some snowfields by Iceberg Lake.

    Soon we made it to Ediza Lake, where there was an option to hike into
    Mammoth directly, or see the Minarets. After some debate, we decided to go
    for the Minarets. My hunger levels were fine, and everybody was stoked to
    get more high route action.
    <p>
      We ate lunch, left Ediza and climbed up some switchbacks to reach Iceberg
      Lake. Not only was this lake stunning, but we could also see the snowfield
      traverse the guy we met earlier had mentioned. It looked sketchy as hell.

    At the snowfield, I went first to deepen the steps in the melty snow. We
    tried real hard not to slip, becuase a fall here would have been a long
    slide directly into the icy water of the lake.

    We all made it across safely! The next part steepened as we got closer to
    Cecile Lake. All og these lakes were super beautiful but not very swimmable
    because the terrain around them contained mostly sharp rocks and big crumbly
    boulders. Boulder hopping took a lot of time.

        },
      ]}
    />
    At Cecile Lake the wind picked up. We had a loose, steep section ahead of
    us, but as it turned but the descent to Minaret Lake wasnt as bad as we were
    warned by people and by the guidebook.

      ]}
    />
    We eventually found a nice foresty campspot by the water. I cooked two
    dinners - Mountain House jambalaya and Shin ramen. We had survived and this
    was our treat before our resupply tomorrow!
