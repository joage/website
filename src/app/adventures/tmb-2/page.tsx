    It was a spectacularly clear morning at Rifugio Elena. After breakfast we began the steep ascent up to the Grand Col Ferret and into Switzerland, watching the valley below get smaller and smaller with each step we climbed.

    At the top of Col Ferret, we said goodbye to Italy and descended into the land of chard, cheese, and chocolates.

As soon as we got down below the clouds it was as if we entered a different world, with entirely new scenery. Switzerlandâ€™s valleys were lush, green, and filled with wildflowers (and pollen, unfortunately for my allergies).

A quick stop in the town of La Fouly to resupply on food later, we continued on towards Champex-Lac. This section of trail featured bucolic Swiss towns instead of grand mountain views; we could not see much of the Mont Blanc Massif.

Finally it was time to ascend again, back into the mountains. Signs and plaques motivated us on the way up to Champex-Lac, giving us helpful insight on the native mushroom species of the area.

    <p>In Champex we had a curious dinner of fish and chips and traditional Swiss rosti, before sharing our hostel with a large guided tour group, one of many which we had seen on the trail.</p>

    <p>Day 2 ended with 26.05km traveled and 996m of elevation gain.</p>
