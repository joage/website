    The next four passes on the HRP were going to be steep and progressively
    more technical. I woke up this morning and left late, but excited for the
    challenge.

    At a river crossing, my map showed the HRP leaving the GR 11 on a faint
    trail. I took a break at the junction and refilled my water bottle in the
    stream to prepare for the climb.

    The trail got steeper and transitioned from grass to reddish colored scree.

    I made it to the col, where clouds rolled over from France into Spain.

    At the col I met a french couple, Jade and Thivo, who were also doing the
    HRP. We descended into the mist together.

    The fog was not too hard to navigate, but as we got lower it turned into
    rain.

        },
      ]}
    />
    I stopped to rest in a cabin at Prat-Caseneuve where I initially planned to
    camp. But because it was still early and the weather was bad I continued on
    to Refuge Soula so I could dry off.
