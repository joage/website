<p>Today was not really a rest day because I still ended up hiking and doing a bunch of extra miles.</p>

In the morning I went to the sport shop in Gavarnie to see if I could fix my broken pole from that night with the wind. The owner told me to grab a coffee and he would replace my pole tips when I got back.

<p>As soon as they were fixed I wanted to go on a test hike. I decided to hitch the 10km up to Col de Tentes and was picked up by the first car I saw. The nice driver was a microbiologist from Bordeaux.</p>

The walk up to Refuge Sarradets was easy and very busy. This was a touristy spot and it was Saturday. However the trail had some cool waterfalls and decent views.

<p>After Sarradets I continued up the scree following a line of people to the Brèche de Roland. I stopped before the last bit because it was getting so crowded and the view looked good enough for me.</p>

As I sat there chilling, Camille appeared! She had hiked all the way up from Gavarnie.

After some debating we decided to finish the last climb up to the Brèche just to see the other side, then have lunch in Refuge Sarradets.

The descent back down to Gavarnie was not trivial because we were at 2800m. Since we didn’t have packs, we moved fast but I still felt pretty tired towards the end.

Back in town, I got a text from Tristan and Tania, whom I hadn’t seen since Lescun! They arrived later that night so we all had dinner together to reunite and celebrate the section of the HRP we had just done.

<p>Tomorrow I move onward to Salardu!</p>

Col des Tentes to Brèche de Roland to Gavarnie - 16.98km and 771m gained.
