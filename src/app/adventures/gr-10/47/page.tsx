    We slept so well after the big dinner and wine. This morning I woke up
    early. The wind had picked up during the night, but now it was calm and
    quiet.

    I sat and watched a red orb rise over the Mediterranean and disappear into
    the clouds. This overcast sky created a cool effect for sunrise.

    Dan and I had bought eggs in Le Perthus for this special occasion, our last
    breakfast.

    Feeling light as ever, we started the descent down to Banyuls beach.

      On the way down, dry yellow hills covered in vineyards made it feel like I
      was coming home in a way.
    </p>
    I had been eager to make it to the end, but this final day was a bit of a
    comedown as we were literally deacending from the peaks to sea level. It
    would take some adjusting to go back to normal life, which Banyuls, a
    tourist town, had a lot of.
    <p>
      When we made it to Banyuls it was 11am. Dan's family was waiting for him.
      I went straight to the beach. I removed my clothes and walked into the
      water.
