I woke up to footsteps outside of my tent. Last night I had set up camp in the dark, so I picked a spot super close to the trail. 

<p>When I looked outside, I saw the two Belgians approaching! I keep running into these guys. Apparently, they had seen me hike past their tent last night.</p>

Today I planned to walk the border ridgeline to Refugi Ull de Ter and hit a few peaks along the way.

<p>The morning climb began in the shade. I was worried I would crash again, like my climb out of L’Hospitalet two days ago, but today I felt a bit more energized after a breakfast of bread, peanut butter, and sheep’s cheese.</p>

After a couple stops to refill my water at a stream and put on sunscreen, I continued the climb up the Vallée d’Eyne. Near the top of the col, I saw a group of 5 or 6 isards leaping across the trail.

I made it to the col after 1.5 hours. It was tiring, but I felt much better than two days ago.

The next section took me over a spectacular ridge spanning 5 grassy peaks. I had the option of summiting each peak as I passed, so I climbed up 3 of them. All along this ridge I had 360 degree views of the surrounding mountains and valleys.

I passed by quite a few people today, and since I was walking along the border of France and Catalonia, I needed to pick a language to say hi to people. Pretty soon I got good at guessing the right language. I noticed that many of the day hikers/runners spoke spanish and catalan, and they traveled in big groups.  The backpackers who looked a bit shy were most likely french.

The last peak in the chain, Pic de la Vaca, had white rocks as its unique feature.

By the time I reached Pic de la Vaca, clouds had formed overhead. There were supposed to be some thunderstorms this afternoon. 

    <ImageGroup images={[{path: "/images/gr-10/IMG_5926.jpeg", caption: "Freser valley"}]} />

I descended quickly down a valley to the river Freser, and immediately ascended back up to a col. Then, following a line of sunday hikers, I descended down to the Refuge d’Ull de Ter. It was only 2:30.

<p>I got a drink and chatted with two French guys from Paris who were going in my direction on the HRP. Water was going to be scarce for the next 25 km.</p>

After they left I realized I had phone signal and spotted a food truck on google maps about 1.5 km away on the trail. I asked someone who worked at the refuge and he confirmed that the food truck was open. I grabbed my bag excitedly and left Ull de Ter.

<p>The food truck was located at a ski resort, and the HRP conveniently passed right through it.</p>

As I ate, the clouds overhead grew darker and darker. It was necessary to  find a place to pitch my tent soon. I hiked out of the ski resort. At a stream, I filled up all my bottles because this was the last water source until Mariailles, which I would reach tomorrow afternoon.

<p>With my bag heavily loaded, I walked up to a col with a lot of flat land for camping. On the way up, I kept watching the darkened sky and hoping that it wouldn’t start to rain.</p>

I set up my tent and threw all my gear inside. I laid down inside and waited, but the storm never came. I could see the clouds in the distance drooping down and connecting with the land. At one point I heard thunder but it was far away. Not a single drop of rain hit my tent today.

After I made dinner, the sun came out again for a brief moment before setting behind the mountains. I went for a short walk to get a view of Pic de Canigou then returned to my tent to sleep.

Today had some really cool scenery and confusing weather. I realized that most day hikers in the Pyrenees were not as concerned about the potential storms as I was, because I saw a bunch of families with little kids continue to hike up even as the sky grew dark.
