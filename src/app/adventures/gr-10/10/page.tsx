    I woke up this morning to a fabulous view of the Pic d’Anie from outside my
    tent. For once the morning was clear and my tent wasn’t even wet! Tristan
    and I left at around 8:30 to begin our climb of the 2500m peak.

    The path followed the HRP over a rocky landscape to the Col des Anies, where
    I dropped my pack. The conditions seemed perfect, a little hot but breezy,
    ideal for summiting.

    The final 500m to the top did not feel too difficult, especially without a
    heavy load on my back.

    At the top we got a stunning panorama of the High Pyrenees peaks, notably
    Pic du Midi d’Ossau in the foreground. Even though we were not that high up
    (2500m), this summit felt super epic because of the low clouds covering the
    valleys below.

    On the way down, I said goodbye to Tristan for now. He headed back to Refuge
    Jeandel for one more night, and I made my way down the other side of the Col
    des Anies toward Lescun.

    />
    After I descended 1000m, I passed the first cabane which was occupied by a
    shepherd. I continued on and planted my tent across the trail from the
    closed Cabane d’Ardinet.

    Refuge Jeandel to Pic d'Anie to Cabane d'Ardinet - 15.00km and 1280m gained.
