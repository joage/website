Today I left Val Ferrera with Pavol, a Slovakian guy I met at the refuge. He was going the same direction as me, into Andorra!

The climb took us up the valley to some lakes where horses grazed.

From the lakes we could see the steep path leading up to the col and over the border.

The last part of the climb was some of the steepest scree I've ever walked on.

After we crossed the border, I dropped my pack to climb up to Coma Pedrosa, the tallest peak in Andorra. Since it was Sunday, there was a crowd of people at the summit.

I took some pictures and met up with Pavol again at the col. We descended to a lake with a perfect spot for swimming.

We made it down to the refuge Comapedrosa early. I had a snack and a beer, and cooked two meals while waiting for the sun to go down. On the HRP, when I'm not walking, I'm most likely eating. Tomorrow will be a day in town for a resupply on food and camping gas (and probably some beers). I will spend 3 days crossing Andorra, and the first day's scenery has already set a high bar for the next two to come!
