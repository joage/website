    During the night a party took place in the square just outside my hostel in
    La Massana. Nobody in my room could get any sleep until after the thumping
    music subsided at 3 am.
    <p>
      In the morning, I found out that yesterday was the annual fiesta for the
      village, and I happened to visit this otherwise quiet town on the exact
      day of its big event!
    </p>
    After I had some espresso, made myself an eggy breakfast, and packed a
    lunch, I was ready to head out into the mountains once more. I took a bus to
    El Serrat, and started my walk around 12:30.

    The afternoon climb felt incredibly sluggish. I always go slower after
    spending some time in a town, but today was especially lazy because of my
    lack of sleep last night. Thankfully a constant breeze kept me from
    overheating in the direct sunlight.

    Near the top of the col, I saw some horses. Andorra has been weirdly free of
    farm animals compared to France and Spain, so this was a surprise.

    There is really good LTE phone signal in this country. I stayed connected
    throughout the day, thanks to Andorra Telecom.

    A magnificent view greeted me at the col, but it was windy. I descended to a
    perfectly oval lake to have lunch and a swim. My paté-filled baguette was
    still fresh, and the water did not feel too cold!

    I took my time at the lake, for I had just decided to end my day only a few
    kilometers away, near some streams. Around 5 pm I got back on my feet to
    finish the hike.
    <p>
      When I got to my intended camp spot, it was filled with people. A big
      group of multiple families had also decided to camp here, but the area was
      big and I chose an island by a small lake to pitch my tent.

    The Andorrans are so lucky to have such easy access to beautiful mountains!
