Today was a short day so I slept in and had a big breakfast of mashed potatos. The signage said it would take only 5 hours to Oulettes de Gaube from Wallon.

I began the hike a couple hours after my friends had left.

The walk was lovely, and I passed some lakes before tackling the two Cols of the day. Neither felt too difficult, especially after a generous break to have lunch.

When I crested the second col, the north face of Vignemale, an iconic Pyrenean peak came into view.

After a 500m descent I made it to the Gaube valley, an expansive glacial meadow with a touristy refuge at the far end.

The whole walk only took 4 hours, including breaks and lunch. Since there were supposed to be storms tonight, I selected a nice sheltered spot to plant my tent. I spent the rest of my day cooking and eating lots of food to lighten my pack. The next resupply point in Gavarnie was soon approaching!
