    A day of eating well is how I'd describe today. It feels like vacation mode
    now.

    We only had an easy descent to Le Perthus this morning. On the way, we
    passed by some roman ruins and a tower-like building which was still intact.

    It was only 8:30 in Le Perthus, but the kebab place opened early for the
    road trippers crossing the border. Half of the town lies in France, and the
    other half in Spain. We bought some wine and ingredients for dinner from the
    Spanish side.

    The next part involved a long road walk up to Col Ouillat, a place with a
    gite and restaurant. Today was not as hot but after 12km on a gradual 6%
    grade we were tired and hungry again.

        },

    After lunch we asked the bartender to open up our wine bottle before setting
    off again. This would be the last climb ever on the HRP!

    We planned to stop for a nap at Pic Neulos but there were too many radio
    antennae making loud noises there.

        },
      ]}
    />
    We continued along the ridge until we found a water fountain at Tanyareda.
    This would be the last water before Banyuls beach. As we rested, I booked a
    hotel for the next night in Banyuls. We could see the sea now!
    <p>
      It got colder and windier in the time we sat resting. Now the plan was to
      continue along the ridge until we found a place to camp overlooking the
      Mediterranean. We wanted to see the sunrise tomorrow.

        },
      ]}
    />
    At Pic des Quatre Termes, we could view the sea more clearly. Banyuls was
    blocked by a mountain, but the Cap de Creus, Argel√®s, and several small
    red-roofed towns were visible on the coastline. Even though it was pretty
    windy, we set up our tents here. It was our last night of camping so we had
    to feast!
