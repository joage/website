    Last night Tristan and Tania asked me if I wanted to climb the Pic d’Orhi, the first 2000m peak in the Pyrénées. I said yes, so today I left the GR 10 temporarily to do the HRP (Haute Route Pyrénées). The HRP is a trail which runs parallel to the GR 10 but stays at higher elevations and involves some route-finding.

<p>We left Iraty after a big breakfast and headed up the first col. Pic d’Orhi stood high above us, and we forged ahead despite the strong winds.</p>

The 700m climb was a test of our ability in both navigation and physical endurance, so it served as a good indicator of whether we were ready for further segments of the HRP. This morning my legs struggled with a lack of energy, but seeing my friends ahead of me was good motivation to continue up the steep slope.

A few final ups and downs later, we made it to the summit of Orhi.

At the summit we met some Swiss HRP hikers who let us peek at their guidebook. Feeling stoked to stay high above the cloudy weather, we made the decision after some deliberation to continue on the HRP rather than descending into Larrau as originally planned.

The final 5km road walk took us to Cabane d’Ardane, an unstaffed shepherd’s hut (bothy) where we met a friendly family cooking dinner, and some fellow campers. Here we set up our tents, and fell asleep instantly after dinner, tired from a long day of trekking and exposure.

<p>Today was such an interesting day! The HRP came furnished with epic vistas, dramatic weather, more athletic company, and a sense of wilderness that I had not yet experienced on the GR 10. Excited to continue on the high route!</p>

Chalets d'Iraty to Cabane d'Ardane - 21.20km and 1254m gained.
