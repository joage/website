I got up pretty early today to avoid walking in the sun. The morning climb looked better and felt easier in the shade.

Cows dominated this valley, but once I climbed above a meadow, horses took their place.

I quickly made it up the gentle slope to Col de Sellente.

After the col, I descended to a hut by a lake to have lunch. It was still early so I went for a quick swim in the water, which was too cold for me.

Some time later, I continued down the valley to a stream. I dipped my feet in before continuing to Val Ferrera. It was a really hot day.

At the refuge, I ate dinner and met some other hikers, including one guy who was doing the HRP but also climbing a bunch of peaks as side quests. He did 3000m of climbing today, which is insane.
