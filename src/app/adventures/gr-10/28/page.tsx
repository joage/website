    Today I took a direct path down a road to Arties, where I pited my tent at a campground. Here I wanted to spend two nights to rest before the next section of the HRP.

Arties is located in between Salard√∫ and Vielha, so I could easily hitchhike or take a bus between the three towns. Here are some pics from my rest day.
