    Today I took a direct path down a road to Arties, where I pitched my tent at
    a campground. Here I wanted to spend two nights to rest before the next
    section of the HRP.

    Arties is located in between Salard√∫ and Vielha, so I could easily hitchhike
    or take a bus between the three towns. Here are some pics from my rest days.
