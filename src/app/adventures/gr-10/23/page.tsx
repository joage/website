I left super late this morning because the hotel room was too comfortable. Today I followed the GR 11 (Spanish Pyrenees route) the entire time. 

<p>The trail out of Parzan climbed a dirt road 1200m to a Col.</p>

The GR 11 then descended down into a cow-filled valley. I could hear moos echoing all around.

<p>I made it to the campground relatively early. It was a really nice spot, and I planted my tent next to two English speaking GR 11 hikers, Bart and Lubo.</p>

The GR 11 was a nice change to the remoteness of the HRP. The trail was very well-marked and the people were friendly!

<p>Parzan to Camping El Forcallo - 20.63km and 1283m gained.</p>
