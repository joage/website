    This morning clear skies and a hot sun accompanied me to the hilltops above Saint Étienne de Baïgorry.

    Not much can be said about today’s hiking. Still pretty of course, but the rolling hills of Basque Country have started to blend together. Seeing old faces from earlier days on trail and meeting new faces helped pass the time along my walk to Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port.

    Saint Jean was an interesting town, the biggest one I’ve seen since day 1. People start the Camino de Santiago here, and walking around I could hear many english voices, a rarity thus far in the trip.

    I booked a gîte here for the night, and I intended to make the most out of it. After checking in and doing some laundry I went directly to the supermarket to get ingredients for dinner. It felt so nice to cook a meal in a real kitchen. I charged all my devices, uploaded some trip reports, showered, got rid of extra clothes, and repacked my bag for the days to come. So far I’m really satisfied with all the gear I brought, but I always end up with too many clothes!
