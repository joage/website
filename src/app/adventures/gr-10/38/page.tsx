Rest day. I woke up in the campground at L’Hospitalet-près-l’Andorre. The name of this town means “hospice near Andorra”. Even by French standards it’s a weird name.

Today was a day of rail travel. I took the first train in the morning to Mérens-les-Vals. This was also a tiny town but the GR 10 passes through it. I passed many hikers on my way to the hot springs.

A short but steep hike led to the springs, which had several pools. There was only one guy soaking.  Some other people were camped out nearby, still sleeping probably. I had arrived early enough!

I enjoyed the warm water for twenty minutes before it started to get too hot. With my clothes back on, I hiked back down to the village. The only store and cafe was located inside the train station. I got a coffee and bought some ramen and cereal bars.

The next train to Ax-les-Thermes would arrive in two hours. Checking the schedule further, I realized I could take the opposite train back to L’Hospitalet, take a shower and do my laundry, then catch the following train back to Merens and then Ax. Since I was traveling one station each time, it only cost 1.50 euro a ride but the online checkout process felt like booking a plane ticket.

A couple hours later, I was showered and ready to explore Ax-les-Thermes.

Ax had a very scenic river walk. I had two meals here and bought groceries for the HRP, including peanut butter which is super rare in the Pyrenees!

At the end of the day, I hopped on the last train back to L’Hospitalet. These tiny French villages are so well connected by the SNCF. Ax was very pretty but also very touri$ty. Mérens felt rustic and old. L’hospitalet is a border town, so the bakery was busy with hungry road trippers just entering France from Andorra and Spain.


I went back to L'Hospitalet
