    I only had one goal in mind for today-to swim in a lake. My body needed a
    break from the past few days of high cols and difficult hiking, so I kept
    the mileage short in order to relax.

    By the road in Espitau de Vielha, I ran into Dan and Benjamin, two HRP
    hikers who had done the same itinerary as me yesterday. They shared my
    desire to bathe in cold water today.

      After I ate a big lunch, I climbed a gentle slope following the GR 11. It
      was not a difficult trail but I still felt tired from yesterday.

    I reached the Lake Rius by mid-afternoon, so I had plenty of time to swim
    and lay in the sun. I may have stayed a bit too long because the next day I
    felt a slight sunburn on my chest.

    For the final part of the day, I descended 7 km along the GR 11 and climbed
    a short but steep hill to my destination, Refugi Restanca by a dammed lake.
    Here I ran into Benjamin and Dan again, so we had a drink. They left to
    bivouac somewhere, and I decided to stay in the refuge. I spent the rest of
    the day cooking all of my food and eating way too much mashed potatoes.

    Tomorrow I will be in Salard√∫, a town and resupply point!
