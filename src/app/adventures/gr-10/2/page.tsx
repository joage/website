    The day started with a climb to a small Col, where I suddenly heard voices yelling. When I got closer it turned out there was a mountain railroad carrying people up to La Rhûne, a 900m peak. Since it was cloudy and my left foot still felt sore from the TMB, I elected to not climb La Rhûne and just make it to Sare as quickly as possible.

At Sare I had a big meal to make up for my hasty dinner last night. I thought Sare was a touristy town but nothing would prepare me for the touristyness in Ainhoa, where I was headed.

The path to Ainhoa followed rural roads where little kids rode bikes, then dipped into ravines where streams separated farmers fields.

  Walking into Ainhoa on the main road felt a bit like disneyland. The houses were painted uniformly and nobody looked local. The lady at the tourism office told me there are no grocery shops or even stores, other than Basque gift shops, in town. I got a quick bite to eat at a restaurant, prepared myself to potentially stealth camp tonight, then left once again for the mountains.

The final climb was super hot, and no trees offered me shade. When i made it to the church where I planned to pitch my tent I was relieved to see 4-5 other tents already set up, so apparently camping was allowed here. There was even a trash bin and a drinking water fountain.

The view of Ainhoa and La Rhûne was great here, and I could finally see come far I walked today. Sheep’s bells lulled me to sleep.
