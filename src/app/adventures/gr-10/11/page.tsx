    This morning I was rudely awoken by donkeys sniffing around and munching outside my tent. Apparently I had camped in prime grazing territory and all types of farm animals paid me a visit during the night.

    Today was a rest day, with only a 2 hr descent to Lescun. However before I could actually rest I had to navigate the rain on the way down.

    As I got closer to town, my day got considerably better. Lescun was the perfect location to take a day off. There was even space in the g√Æte so I could wash my clothes and sleep in a bed.

    I spent the day hanging out with Thomas, Claudia, and Leo. I also got rid of some of unnecessary weight, refilled on food, and had two delicious sit-down meals. Tomorrow I begin the most spectacular section of the HRP!
