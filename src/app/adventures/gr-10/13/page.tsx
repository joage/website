    Today was a day with an unknown destination, because I wasn’t sure how far I
    could go. I did know that I wanted to make it to Spain in order to resupply
    on food, and possibly make it back into France later on.

    As I descended from Arlet, high mountain ridges turned into shaded forest
    paths. At a river crossing I chose one of two available routes which took me
    up to a lake where families were having lunch.

    I ate my sandwich here and joined up with the GR 11, a long distance path
    through the Spanish side of the Pyrenees.

    The GR 11 felt different from the GR 10. The trail was rougher and less
    traveled.

    When I made it to Candanchu, a Spanish ski town, it was 3pm. I had a drink
    with a German hiker while waiting for the food shop to reopen after their
    siesta. The town was pretty empty but at least there was lots of jamón in
    the grocery store!

    After resupplying, I realized I was not going to make it back into France
    today. The final part of the day involved some road walking and then a big
    climb to a lake.
    <p>
      Since I was low on cash, I tried to find an ATM in Astún. In my broken
      Spanish I asked some locals for help but they were only able to direct me
      to a wall where there used to be an ATM. Mission failed.
    </p>
    The final climb was windy, and when I arrived at the lake the wind picked up
    speed. I knew it was a bad idea to pitch my tent here, but I didn’t want to
    keep hiking. I cooked my dinner and hoped the wind would die down so I could
    get some sleep.
