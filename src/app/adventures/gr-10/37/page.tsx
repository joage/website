    I looked outside my tent this morning and saw an epic view from my island.
    The sky was overcast and a small sliver of sunlight illuminated the distant
    peaks.
    <p>
      Today the HRP would take me out of Andorra and back into France. I planned
      to get as close as possible to the next town, L'Hospitalet.
    </p>
    On the first climb, I felt extremely weak and took many breaks.

    After the first col I started to find my rhythm.

    At Refugi Juclar, I got a sandwich and contemplated my plan for the rest of
    the day. There was a 35% chance of rain in a couple hours, and I could
    either wait out the storm here, or try and make it over the next col. I went
    back and forth but ultimately decided to keep going, since the col was
    close.

    The descent into France from Col de l'Albe began with a lot of rock hopping
    under a darkened sky. The boulders went on past two lakes, before giving way
    to easier trail. A splash of rain made me take out my jacket, only to
    immediately put it back in my bag once the rain stopped and it got too hot.

        },
      ]}
    />
    I saw so many swimmable blue lakes. Unfortunately I could not take a dip,
    because the weather worried me, and I had to get down before it began to
    rain again.

    The final descent to L’Hospitalet-près-l’Andorre took me into a deep valley.
    The sun set over the high ridges as I walked into town.

    I pitched my tent at the municipal campground, where I planned to stay two
    nights.
    <p>
      L’Hospitalet is a tiny village but it has a train station on the main line
      to Toulouse. Tomorrow I will take a train to Mérens-les-Vals to soak in a
      hot spring, and then I might go to Ax-les-Thermes to have a meal and
      explore!
