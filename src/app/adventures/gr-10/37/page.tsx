I looked outside my tent this morning and saw an epic view from my island. The sky was overcast and a small sliver of sunlight illuminated the distant peaks.

<p>Today the HRP would take me out of Andorra and back into France. I planned to get as close as possible to the next town, L'Hospitalet.</p>

On the first climb, I went extremely weak and took many breaks.

After the first col I started to find my rhythm.

The descent into France began with a lot of rock hopping under a darkened sky. The boulders went on past two lakes, before giving way to easier trail. A splash of rain made me take out my jacket, only to immediately put it back in my bag once the rain stopped and it got too hot.

I saw so many swimmable blue lakes. Unfortunately I could not take a dip, because the weather worried me, and I had to get down before it began to rain again.

The final descent to L’Hospitalet-près-l’Andorre took me past a dammed lake and into a deep valley. The sun set over the high ridges as I walked into town.

I pitched my tent at the municipal campground, where I planned to stay two nights. 

L’Hospitalet is a tiny village but it has a train station on the main line to Toulouse. Tomorrow I will take a train to Mérens-les-Vals to soak in a hot spring, and then I might go to Ax-les-Thermes to have a meal and explore!
