    After a day of sitting around in Lescun, my legs were somewhat rested and
    ready to take on the Haute Pyrénées. The next stretch of the HRP is supposed
    to be one of the best parts!

    I started the day’s walk with two other hikers I met in the gîte, Leo and
    Camille. We gradually climbed out of Lescun, into the countryside and then
    up a forested valley.

    />
    When the HRP split off from the GR 10, we said goodbye to Leo, and Camille
    and I continued up to Col de Pau.

    By lunchtime we were ahead of schedule and only 6km lay between us and Lac
    d’Arlet, our destination. Fresh legs and good weather can make such a
    difference!

    I made it to Lac d’Arlet around 2:30, which left me plenty of time to relax,
    take a dip, and plan my next day’s path. The bivy spot next to the refuge
    was spacious and flat.
