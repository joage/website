    We were gassed today. It was so hot, even at 6am when we started the climb
    out of Arles.

    The 600m climb led us over a small col. We sweated profusely. While we
    stopped for a break, Dan and I decided to take a short day and end at the
    Mas de la Fargassa. It was simply too hot to keep going during the daytime.

    We reached a road which took us along the river to a place called Mas de la
    Fargassa, an "ecog√Æte" run by a Dutch family. They informed us it was Indian
    food night, so we eagerly set up our tents here.

      We spent the rest of the hot day swimming in the river and taking naps.
      Dinner was insanely good. This was a magical place.
