    A hot day. I am nearing the end, where the valleys are lower and drier.
    Today I would be descending to Arles-sur-Tech where it was forecasted to be
    100 degrees F.

        },
      ]}
    />
    I started my walk in the forest. The path did not climb or descend, but
    rather countoured around the mountain while staying at around the same
    elevation.

    A couple hours in, the trail started to ascend. I struggled up to the col in
    the heat as the sun got higher in the sky.

    I descended the dry grassy slopes to Refuge Batère, where I found David, an
    HRP hiker from Manchester I'd met 3 weeks ago near Gavarnie. I ate a meal of
    hot pasta in the heat, and then continued on toward Arles.

        },
      ]}
    />
    The 3hr walk down left me sweaty and tired. I pitched my tent in the hard
    ground at the Arles Camping, and quickly headed to the grocery store before
    they closed.

        },
      ]}
    />
    David and I got a dinner at the only open restaurant. Later, Dan showed up
    after walking 38 km! He had been doing some long days to catch up after
    getting sick. We had some pizza to celebrate the reunion. I had a cold
    shower afterwards to cool myself down before bed. Tomorrow we start early to
    beat the heat!
