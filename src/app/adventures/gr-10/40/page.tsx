    Today I left camp super late. I kept going back to sleep after waking up,
    until cows started mooing and splashing in the stream close by. Some got
    close enough for me to open my tent and shoo them off. It was as if they
    were telling me stop being lazy and to get going.
    <p>
      The day would start with a long downhill, followed by some towns, and then
      an undetermined amount of uphill depending on how tired I would be.
    </p>
    An hour in, I reached a large lake where families were playing in the water.
    I kept going for a bit along the edge of the water until I found a nice
    secluded spot to jump in. I don’t carry any swimwear so its always awkward
    swimming nude next to many swimsuit-clad day hikers.

    When I passed the lake’s dam, a gentle track led me into some trees. The
    miles passed quickly, and by some shade I stopped to have lunch.

    Near Bolquère I ran into the two Belgians again. We walked through the
    forest outside town together, and parted ways when I had to go buy
    groceries.

    The small market in Bolquere had a siesta and didn’t reopen until 4pm, so I
    sat outside eating the rest of my food.

    After I resupplied, I walked the 5k toward Eyne, the next village in the
    wide valley.

    At a railroad, I left the GR 10 and continued through farmland.

    The weather was looking stormy up high on the hills where I was heading, so
    I decided to stop in Eyne and have a meal. As I waited for their kitchen to
    open at 7, I had a couple beers and wrote this trip report.

        },
      ]}
    />
    Later I ordered the plat du jour which was veaux cooked in dijon. I loved
    that it came with vegetables slathered in olive oil—I am getting close to
    the Mediterranean! It was one of the best dinners I’ve had this trip.
    <p>
      The servers were nice and even offered to let me camp behind the
      restaurant.

    I didn’t want to leave Eyne, but it was time to get going. At 8pm as the sun
    set, I started the climb out of the town and into a deep, narrow canyon.
    With my music playing, I moved fast. At 1870m and 1950m, I saw some flat
    land for camping. Although it was getting dark, I didnt stop.

    I wanted to get as close to the col as possible to avoid climbing in the
    heat tomorrow, so I took out my headlamp and continued on.
    <p>
      At 2150m, I saw a tent and realized there was campable ground. I pitched
      my tent a little further up the trail and went immediately to bed, having
      already brushed my teeth at the restaurant.
    </p>
    Today felt different in scenery, towns, and food. It was a reminder that I
    was nearing the end of my journey! It feels like the hardest parts are
    behind me, and now the pastoral feel, reminiscent of the early days on
    trail, has returned. I’m learning to slow down and take my time, especially
    in the tiny villages where life does not respect the rigorous schedule of a
    HRP hiker. I’m excited for tomorrow, which should be an epic day walking on
    a high ridgeline.
