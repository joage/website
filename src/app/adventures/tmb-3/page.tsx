    <p>
      Since yesterday was so long, today the goal was to chill and take the
      flatter of two routes to Trient. We left Champex in no rush, thinking it
      would be an easy day with not so much climbing. That plan quickly devolved
      when we came across the fork, and saw a huge guided group head the way we
      were planning to go. Emma and I discussed our options a bit and decided
      instead to go for the high route through the Fenêtre d’Arpette.

    The moment we entered the Val d’Arpette we knew that we had made the right
    move. Rising slowly at first through green meadows and pine forest, then
    sharply over rocky, snow-streaked terrain, this trail reminded me of the
    approaches to high peaks back home in California’s eastern sierra.

    At 1100m of ascent, we crested the col and peered into the Trient valley
    below.

    We took in the views, had lunch, and started the long descent to Trient with
    no shade.

    At around 5, we strolled into Trient but our day didn’t end there. Because
    of how late we had planned this trip we had to book a stay in the next town
    over in Le Châtelard - Finhaut. Feeling hungry and not wanting to wait for
    the bus to come at 7:30, we tried to hitch a ride by the road and were
    instantly picked up by a kind local. After he dropped us off in Le Châtelard
    we climbed the final 200m to our gîte for the night, hosted by a really nice
    lady, Jacqueline, who was retired and had 3 kittens. Dinner was family style
    and incredibly good—it was so worth the extra mileage to come here!

    Day 3 was 15.95 km with 1364m of elevation gained.
