      In Fall 2021 my coworker David and I schemed up a plan to climb a lesser
      known California 14er. Mount Sill at 14,159 ft looked ideal, with its
      relatively short approach and an easy road to the parking lot. Although
      various trip reports warned us about the bushwhacking, boulder fields, and
      routefinding through class 3/4 terrain, we really had no idea what to
      expect from this off-trail adventure.
    </p>
    I had just moved to LA a month prior, and so had my dear friends Sam and
    Chenyu. They were eager to join us for Sill, so our group became 4 total.
    <p>
      After a big Thai dinner on Friday night, we began the 5 hr drive to Big
      Pine Creek Campground, set up our tents in the dark and waited for
      morning. The goal for Saturday was to reach 11000 ft and position
      ourselves for a summit attempt on Sunday.

    The hike began at 7800 ft on the floor of a wide valley. Just as we passed a
    split in the trail to continue along the South Fork of Big Pine creek,
    Chenyu got stung in the face by a wasp. As painful as it was, he decided to
    soldier on, and pretty soon we reached a creek crossing in a thick part of
    the aspen forest.

    The trail zigzagged up a steep wall, avoiding a waterfall on a rocky lip,
    and soonafter we caught our first view of Mount Sill. From here the trail
    grew fainter and fainter until there was no longer a trail at all. David
    navigated us through a tricky forested section to reach a boulder field. The
    going got much slower, and the last 1000 ft climb up to Elinor lake had some
    steep gullys with overgrown bush. I was relieved when we decided to stop and
    set up camp by the lake's edge at 11000 ft. We cooked dinner and went to bed
    without setting an alarm, thinking that there'd be plenty of time to summit
    the next day.
    <p>
      On Sunday morning we caught a beautiful sunrise casting alpenglow on the
      Palisade Crest high above the lake. Mount Sill was the rightmost and
      tallest peak in the crest. We filled our day packs, put on helmets, and
      started up several rocky ledges. The boulder fields went on forever, but
      so far nothing was too technical yet. The hard part was navigation.

    There were two possible routes when we reached the unnamed glacial lake at
    12200 ft. By this point, Sam had decided to call it a day and head back to
    camp. After some debate, David, Chenyu, and I decided to go left of the
    lake. Halfway across the lake, we realized this steep traverse was chossy
    and unstable. We couldn't see an obvious path continuing up to Glacier
    Notch. It was getting close to turnaround time, and even if we kept going,
    we didn't know if it was even possible to get up to Glacier Notch from the
    path we had chosen. At around 12400 ft, the three of us began retracing our
    steps and descending down to camp to join Sam.

      After a short break back at Elinor Lake, we packed up camp and began our
      descent down to the car, which was a challenge in itself. The terrain
      features on the way down looked much different than on the way up, so we
      got lost a couple times. All of us had work the next day, so once we made
      it back to the car here was no time for dillydallying. Driving back to LA,
      we all knew that this weekend's big adventure would be on our minds for a
      while.

    <p className="font-bold">Ten months later...</p>
    <p>
      Skip ahead to August 2022! I was no longer living in LA but planned to be
      there for a work trip. David was down to give Sill another shot while I
      was in town so we teamed up, this time just the two of us. The idea was to
      try a slightly different route avoiding Elinor Lake and improve upon our
      mistakes we made last time. Once again we drove up from LA on a Friday
      night to begin our second attempt.
    </p>
    It was cool to see the same trail in a different season. The creek had much
    more water at this time of year, and the crossing was a bit trickier. We
    followed the same route as last year until around 10400 ft. Here we took the
    drainage to the right instead of to the left toward Elinor Lake. This new
    path felt like the correct one because there was a lot less bushwhacking.
    The terrain felt smoother and slabbier. Just as the sun disappeared behind
    Mount Sill, we made it up to the unnamed glacial lake where we turned around
    last year. Setting up camp here had us feeling much more confident to reach
    the summit the next day.

    Unlike last year, we set our alarms and woke up before sunrise to start the
    summit push. Going right of the lake, we crept up the steep wall diagonally.
    The path was not at all obvious, and it was a matter of picking which class
    3 chute to go up. By the end of the morning we made it to the saddle between
    Mt Gayley and Mt Sill. There were some sketchy moves in this section where
    slipping was not allowed.

        },
      ]}
    />
    From the saddle we could see the Palisade Glacier on the other side of the
    ridge. We could also see Glacier Notch, our next objective, and there was
    only one way up. Unfortunately the way was extremely steep and loose.
    Although David felt more comfortable on this type of terrain, I did not like
    the feeling of large unstable rocks under my feet. Fearing an ankle sprain
    and knowing the downclimb would be even worse, I decided to head down. David
    didn't want to continue alone, so we both called it here. It had been a
    worthy attempt but the summit was simply out of reach, another 1000 vertical
    ft of hard scrambling away.

    />
    This year we made it up to 13000 ft before turning around. Our camp spot was
    better, and we had started the summit day much earlier. It was a skill and
    stamina issue that prevented us from summitting, and I consoled myself
    knowing that we didn't make any big mistakes this time.
    <p>
      Looking back on these two trips, I realized that sometimes we just need a
      reason to get together and enjoy the beauty and challenge of the high
      Sierra. Climbing Mount Sill was that reason. Getting to the top would have
      been nice, but the real mission had already been accomplished.
