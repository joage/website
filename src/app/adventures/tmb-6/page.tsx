    <p>Day 6 was the uneventful hike down to the bus station so instead of writing about it I’ll focus on the food we ate during the entire trip.</p>

    <p>Mont Blanc is not just about nature, its also about eating, drinking, and sampling the cuisine of 3 countries because you are never too far from a village with a food store. With the exception of Danish canned fish (from my 2 day layover in Copenhagen) and random junk food snacks, everything else we packed was local to the region we were in!</p>

    The wine tour of mont blanc was fun, and totally worth sacrificing one plastic smartwater bottle to carry wine up the mountain each day instead of water. After taking the bus and train from Chamonix to Geneva to Paris, I had a few days to rest up before embarking on my next mission in the south of France. Emma had to go back to work, so I will be solo for the rest of my time in Europe!
