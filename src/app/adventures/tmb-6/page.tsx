    <p>Day 6 was the uneventful hike down to the bus station so instead of writing about it I’ll focus on the food we ate during the entire trip.</p>

    <p>Mont Blanc is not just about nature, its also about eating, drinking, and sampling the cuisine of 3 countries because you are never too far from a village with a food store. With the exception of Danish canned fish (from my 2 day layover in Copenhagen) and random junk food snacks, everything else we packed was local to the region we were in!</p>

    The wine tour of mont blanc was fun, and totally worth sacrificing one plastic smartwater bottle to carry wine up the mountain each day instead of water. 

<p>After taking the bus and train from Chamonix to Geneva to Paris, I had a few days to rest up before embarking on my next hike in the south of France. Emma had to go back to work, so I will be solo for the rest of my time in Europe!</p>
